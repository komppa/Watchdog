# Watchdog

**~ Keep your loved ones safe using Thingy:91**

## Getting started

### Nrf-Watchdog

Thingy:91 implementation of Watchdog. 
Runs perfectly on nrf9160.

### React-Watchdog

Go to the react-wd folder and download dependencies and node modules using command:

```bash
npm install
```

After that you'll have new folder 'node-modules' and dependencies that are required by project. Now Watchdog's web portal can be launched executing command (in folder react-wd)

```bash
npm start
```


### NodeJS-Watchdog

Go to the node-wd directory in order to run Watchdog's NodeJS. I recommend using 'nodemon' for that.
```bash
nodemon 
```

**Have fun with it :)**
